# Sorting Visualizer

We have learnt many sorting algorithms. But often we fail to understand the core idea of a particular algorithm maybe because we are unable to visualize how they work. So the most important thing to understand about these algorithms is visualization. 

So decided to Create a web application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript to visualize how various sorting algorithms work and how elements are swapped in the array to get to the sorted array in the end.

## Features

- Colored representation of step being executed. 
  - Blue: Default 
  - Yellow : Being compared 
  - Red : Identified as in incorrect position and to be moved 
  - Green : In correct position
- Three Controls for visualizations : 
  - Generation of new data array (Randomly generate new array).
  - Set size of data array in range certain range.
  - Speed of visualization (5 speed levels)  



## Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript


## Challenges I ran into

- **Writing sort algorithms in JS :** I faced writing sort algorithms in JS as I was new to it. Usually to write some code or learn algorithms for solving coding problems,
  I prefer C++/Java. Initially, I took more time to implement the first sort algorithm i.e., Bubble sort to perfectly work. After that, for the remaining algorithms, 
  I took no time and implemented them so quickly one after the other. 

- **Site responsiveness :** As a beginner the first challenge was to bring site responsiveness as I have to learn CSS from scratch (Still have some bugs).
## Conclusion
This was my first project which I was deploying the website live. This was a great learning experience for me creating a full application from scratch.
Thanks to the Crio community for providing the amazing learning experience with #learnbydoing projects.
